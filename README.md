## Overview

This project utilizes Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to generate animated character images. GANs are deep learning models that can learn from a dataset and create new content that closely resembles the training data. We've trained an existing GAN model using a dataset of animated character images and developed a web-based application that allows users to generate unique animated character images by interacting with the GAN model through Gradio, a user-friendly interface.

## Features

- **Image Generation with GANs:** Generate unique and diverse animated character images through interaction with the trained GAN model.
- **Gradio Integration:** Utilize Gradio, a Python library, to create a user-friendly interface for interacting with the trained GAN model and generating animated character images.
- **Easy Customization:** Customize character attributes and fine-tune parameters to create a wide variety of anime characters.

## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of web development
- Foundational knowledge of generative modeling with a focus on GANs
- Proficiency in application development with Python
